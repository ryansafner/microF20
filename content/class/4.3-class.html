<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today we continue our look at market power, by looking at the social consequences of market power: deadweight loss, allocative inefficiency, x-inefficiency, and rent-seeking; as well as the primary causes: barriers to entry of various sorts.</p>

<p>The only way to tell the difference between price discrimination and price differences due to costs in competitive markets (without actually being able to observe the firm’s marginal cost) is to find something that changes the price elasticity of demand without changing the cost. Price discrimination implies that a firm with market power sets its price based on the elasticity of demand and the marginal cost of produc- ing. Price in a competitive market depends only on marginal cost. (This is related to the distinction we discussed in Chapter 9 about how firms with market power react differently than competitive firms to rota- tions in demand.)</p>
