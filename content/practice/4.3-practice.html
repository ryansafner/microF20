<p>Promoters of a major college basketball tournament estimate that the demand for tickets for <em>adults</em> and by <em>students</em> are given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
q_a&amp;=5,000-10p_a\\
q_s&amp;=10,000-100p_s\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> represents adults and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> represents students. They estimate that the marginal and average total cost of seating an additional spectator is constant at $10.</p>
