# Monopoly: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- No market is perfectly competitive (it’s an extreme model); but that does not necessarily imply market failure

- Monopoly &amp; market power are *interesting*
  - Most firms clearly have *some* market power
  - Market power `\(\neq\)` bad, necessarily!

- Today, we’ll examine what I call “the good, the bad, and the ugly” of market power
  - but not necessarily in that order!

# Antitrust and Competition Law II

.pull-left[

- Aren't monopolies illegal in the U.S.?

- **No**: most monopolies exist *because* of explicit or implicit government-backing
  - Some markets actually work *better* as a monopoly (**"the good"**, .hi-purple[natural monopoly], patents, etc.)
  - Some markets and regulators are .hi-purple[captured] via **rent-seeking** firms to block competition (**"the ugly"**)
