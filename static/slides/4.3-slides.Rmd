- The most obvious way to capture more surplus is to raise prices
  - But **Law of Demand** $\implies$ this would turn many customers away!

- Instead, if firm could charge **different** customers with *different WTP* **different** prices for **the same goods**, firm could convert more .blue[consumer surplus] into .green[profit]

$$\underbrace{\frac{p-MC(q)}{p}}_{\text{Markup % of Price}}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

# 3<sup>rd</sup>-Degree Price Discrimination: Numerical Example

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose you run a bar in downtown Frederick, and estimate the nightly demands for beer from undergraduates $(U)$ and graduates $(G)$ to be:

$$\begin{align*}
q_U&=18-4p_U\\
q_G&=12-p_G\\
\end{align*}$$

Assume the only cost of producing a beer is a constant marginal (and average) cost of $2.

]

1. If your bar could not price discriminate, how much profit would the bar earn?

2. If you could price discriminate, how much profit would the bar earn?

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? II

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? III

.pull-left[

- As with markups in general, price discrimination has everything to do with .hi[price elasticity of demand]

- If you are paying too much and losing consumer surplus, the real "problem" is that .hi-purple[your demand is very inelastic]
  - fewer options, a particular brand, or a necessity, limited time, etc

- If you want to pay less, .hi-purple[buy generic] (more elastic)

# How to Be a Savvy Consumer

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Realize that any “sales” and “discounts” are calculate to make *the store* more money

- But it *can* make you better off as a consumer too if you are smart

- Think about your .blue[consumer surplus]!

- If you were *already* planning to buy the product, a fall in price is a good deal for you
  - Your demand is less elastic

- If you *weren’t* going to buy the product before, and now you do, the sale was effective for the store, and you likely don’t get much surplus
  - Your demand is more elastic

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- .hi[Price discrimination] is selling *identical* goods to people at different prices

- But not everytime people pay different prices means it is price discrimination

- Sometimes it is truly different goods that people are paying different prices for
  - If *costs* to firm are *different* for different versions (color, size, etc.), it is a *different* good, *not* price discrimination

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- .hi-green[Example]: bottled sparkling water often more expensive than Coca Cola
  - Could be because sparkling water drinkers have more elastic demand than Coke drinkers
  - Or could be that it is more expensive to package sparkling water (economies of scale with greater number of Coke drinkers)

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- The only way to tell the difference is to see what happens if demand changes price elasticity (and costs do not change)
  - Price discrimination requires market power, firm with market power marks up price based on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$
  - Competitive firm only sets $p=MC$, so change in elasticity has no effect on price

- See [today’s class notes](/class/4.3-class) for a graphical demonstration
