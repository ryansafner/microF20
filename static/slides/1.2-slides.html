- With the right models and research designs, we *can* say "X causes Y" and quantify it!
- Economists are in a unique position to make *causal* claims that mere statistics cannot

"First, the field of economics has spent decades developing a toolkit aimed at investigating empirical relationships, focusing on techniques to help understand which correlations speak to a causal relationship and which do not. This comes up all the time — does Uber Express Pool grow the full Uber user base, or simply draw in users from other Uber products? Should eBay advertise on Google, or does this simply syphon off people who would have come through organic search anyway? Are African-American Airbnb users rejected on the basis of their race? These are just a few of the countless questions that tech companies are grappling with, investing heavily in understanding the extent of a causal relationship."

&gt; Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence, value does not exist outside the consciousness of men (pp. 120-121).

# Three Insights About Value

.pull-left[

- Value is measured as an .hi-purple[ordinal] concept 
    - We can *rank* our objectives relative to each other (but cannot quantify further)
    - We pursue highest-valued objectives (highest marginal utility) first
    - Pursuing one objective means *not* pursuing others!

# Three Insights About Value

.pull-left[

- Value inherently comes from the fact that we must make .hi-purple[tradeoffs]
    - Making one choice means *having to give up* pursuing others!
    - The choice we pursue at the moment must be worth the sacrifice of others! (i.e. highest marginal utility)
