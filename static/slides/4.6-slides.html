There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. incomplete vs. and asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential game

- See my [game theory course](https://ryansafner.com/courses/econ316/) for more (likely taught next in Fall 2021)

- We use .hi-purple["solution concepts"] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- .hi[Nash Equilibrium] is the primarly solution concept
  - Note it has *many* variants depending on if games are sequential vs. simultaneous, perfect vs. imperfect information, etc.

- Important about Nash equilibrium:

- N.E. `\(\neq\)` the "*best*" or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

- Game may have *multiple* N.E.

- Game may have *no* N.E. (in "pure" strategies)

# Contestable Markets: Recap

.pull-left[
- .hi-purple[Markets are **contestable** if]:
  1. There are no barriers to entry or exit
  2. Firms have similar technologies (i.e. similar cost structure)
  3. There are no sunk costs
  
- Economies of scale need not be inconsistent with competitive markets (as is assumed) if they are contestable

- Generalizes "prefect competition" model in more realistic way, also game-theoretic
